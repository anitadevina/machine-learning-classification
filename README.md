**Logistic Regression Model Training**

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for classification. 
The code applies a machine learning model to a dataset, trains it using the LogisticRegression algorithm, and evaluates the training time. 
The dataset's Response column is used as the target variable, and all other columns are considered as input features


Library used:
1. time: To measure the training time of the model.
2. pickle: For saving and loading machine learning models (though not used in the provided code snippet).
3. pandas: For handling and manipulating data.
4. numpy: For numerical operations.
5. scikit-learn: Provides tools for machine learning
